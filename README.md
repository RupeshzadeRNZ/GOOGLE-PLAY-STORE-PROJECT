# Google Play Store Apps - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Description

The Google Play Store, formerly known as Android Market, is a digital distribution service developed and operated by Google. It serves as the official app store for Android devices, offering a variety of content, including apps, books, magazines, music, movies, and television programs. Users with 'Google-certified' Android devices can download applications from the platform, either for free or at a cost.

Given the rapid growth of Android devices and apps, this project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive valuable insights from Google Play Store data. The dataset used for this analysis is **Google Play Store Apps**, sourced from Kaggle. It contains 10,000 entries of web-scraped Play Store data, which provides a rich opportunity to analyze the Android market.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

The analysis begins by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Pandas, a fast and powerful Python library, is ideal for working with tabular data, such as spreadsheets or CSV files. Various data preparation and cleaning steps were performed to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis. These steps included handling missing values, cleaning data inconsistencies, and ensuring data types were correct.
